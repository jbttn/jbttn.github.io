  <div class="indent1">CINS 490 - Senior Project</div>
  <p class="indent2">I created a Ruby on Rails service which allows users to type in text notes in the Markdown markup language which would be formatted and shareable in HTML format.  During my experimentation with various ideas over the course of the project and was able to create a Node.js service which forked a PhantomJS process to create and serve website screenshots.  I also created a simple API which allowed me to develop an iPhone client for the service.</p>
  <div class="indent1">CSCI 598 - Mobile Development</div>
  <p class="indent2">Developed various applications using the iPhone SDK.  Projects included a scientific calculator which integrated design work from a team in a graphic design class, a client for the Flickr API which used asynchronous loading and was iPad compatible, and a final project which integrated with an API I wrote for a turn based game written for my web development class.</p>
  <div class="indent1">CINS 465 - Web Development</div>
  <p class="indent2">The class focused on the Ruby on Rails framework.  In the class I was exposed to concepts such as Model-View-Controller, Restful resources, and API development.  During the course of the class I built a fully functional web forum and a turn based RPG style game based off of the Pokemon franchise.  The game utilized WebSockets and an API to allow players to play from both a browser and phone in real time.</p>
